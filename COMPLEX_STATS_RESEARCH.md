# Complex Chess Statistics Research

## Overview

This document explores implementing more advanced chess statistics that require analyzing game states, such as:
- **Most backwards moves** (retreating pieces)
- **Biggest piece imbalance** (material advantage swings)
- **Mobility changes** (legal move counts)
- **Space control** (squares controlled by each side)
- **Development tracking** (pieces off starting squares)
- **King safety metrics** (king tropism, threats near king)

## Current Architecture

### JavaScript (chess.js)
**Currently Used For:**
- PGN parsing and move validation
- Basic move tracking (captures, castling, promotions, checks)
- Board state at end of game
- Move history with verbose data

**Capabilities:**
- ✅ Move generation and validation
- ✅ Piece positions via `board()` method
- ✅ Legal moves via `moves({ verbose: true })`
- ✅ Check/checkmate/stalemate detection
- ❌ **No built-in board evaluation**
- ❌ **No material counting helpers**
- ❌ **No space control calculations**

**Key Limitation:** chess.js is headless and focuses on chess rules, not analysis or evaluation.

### Python (python-chess)
**Currently Used For:**
- Stockfish integration for accuracy/ACPL analysis
- Position evaluation (centipawns, win percentages)
- Move quality classification (blunders, mistakes, inaccuracies)

**Capabilities:**
- ✅ Full board state access at each position
- ✅ Legal move generation with `board.legal_moves`
- ✅ Attack/defend calculations with `board.attackers()`
- ✅ Pin detection with `board.is_pinned()`
- ✅ Material counting via `board.piece_map()`
- ✅ Position cloning for state analysis
- ✅ Stockfish integration for deep evaluation
- ✅ FEN parsing and board manipulation

**Advantage:** python-chess has richer state analysis APIs and better Stockfish integration.

### Python-Chess Tactical Analysis APIs
**Built-in Methods:**
- ✅ `board.is_pinned(color, square)` - Detect if a square is pinned
- ✅ `board.pin(color, square)` - Get pin direction/mask
- ✅ `board.attackers(color, square)` - Get all attackers of a square
- ✅ `board.attacks(square)` - Get all squares attacked from a square
- ✅ `board.is_attacked_by(color, square)` - Check if square is attacked
- ✅ X-ray attack detection (via example code in python-chess repo)

**Advantage:** Python-chess has native tactical pattern detection capabilities that JavaScript lacks.

## Proposed Statistics & Implementation Complexity

### TACTICAL PATTERNS 🎯

#### 7. Pins Detected 📌
**Definition:** Detect all pins throughout the game (absolute pins to king).

**Complexity:** 🟢 LOW (Built-in API!)

**Best Approach:** Python (python-chess)
- Native `board.is_pinned()` method
- Already have Python infrastructure

**Implementation:**
```python
def detect_pins_in_game(game):
    """Detect all pins that occurred during the game"""
    board = game.board()
    pins_found = []

    for move_num, move in enumerate(game.mainline_moves()):
        board.push(move)

        # After each move, check all squares for pins
        for square in chess.SQUARES:
            piece = board.piece_at(square)
            if piece and board.is_pinned(piece.color, square):
                # Get the pin direction
                pin_mask = board.pin(piece.color, square)

                # Find the attacking piece creating the pin
                attacker_color = not piece.color
                attackers = board.attackers(attacker_color, square)

                pins_found.append({
                    'moveNumber': move_num + 1,
                    'square': chess.square_name(square),
                    'pinnedPiece': piece.symbol(),
                    'pinnedColor': 'white' if piece.color else 'black',
                    'attackers': [chess.square_name(sq) for sq in attackers]
                })

    return {
        'totalPins': len(pins_found),
        'whitePinned': sum(1 for p in pins_found if p['pinnedColor'] == 'white'),
        'blackPinned': sum(1 for p in pins_found if p['pinnedColor'] == 'black'),
        'mostPinnedGame': max(pins_found, key=lambda x: x['moveNumber']) if pins_found else None
    }
```

**Fun Stats:**
- 📌 "Pin Master" - Player who created the most pins
- 🎯 "Pinned and Helpless" - Most pieces pinned in one game
- 🔒 "Pin Parade" - Game with most total pins

**Effort:** 2-3 hours (very straightforward with built-in API)

**Performance:** Minimal (~1-2 seconds for 20 games)

#### 8. Skewers Detected �串
**Definition:** Detect skewers (x-ray attacks on valuable pieces with less valuable behind).

**Complexity:** 🟡 MEDIUM

**Best Approach:** Python (python-chess)
- Use x-ray attack detection (example code available)
- Check piece values to identify skewers

**Implementation:**
```python
PIECE_VALUES = {
    chess.PAWN: 1,
    chess.KNIGHT: 3,
    chess.BISHOP: 3,
    chess.ROOK: 5,
    chess.QUEEN: 9,
    chess.KING: 100
}

def xray_rook_attackers(board, color, square):
    """Detect rook x-ray attacks (from python-chess examples)"""
    attacks = board.attacks_mask(square)
    blockers = attacks & board.occupied_co[not color]

    # Remove more valuable blockers (queens, kings)
    blockers &= ~board.queens & ~board.kings

    # Compute attacks through cleared blockers
    return board.attacks_mask(square) & board.occupied_co[color] & ~blockers

def xray_bishop_attackers(board, color, square):
    """Detect bishop x-ray attacks"""
    attacks = board.attacks_mask(square)
    blockers = attacks & board.occupied_co[not color]

    # Remove more valuable blockers (rooks, queens, kings)
    blockers &= ~board.rooks & ~board.queens & ~board.kings

    return board.attacks_mask(square) & board.occupied_co[color] & ~blockers

def detect_skewers(game):
    """Detect skewers in the game"""
    board = game.board()
    skewers = []

    for move_num, move in enumerate(game.mainline_moves()):
        board.push(move)

        # Check if the move created a skewer (attacked high value piece with lower value behind)
        if move.captured:
            continue  # Skewers involve threats, not immediate captures

        attacking_piece = board.piece_at(move.to_square)
        if not attacking_piece:
            continue

        # Check what the moved piece now attacks
        attacked_squares = board.attacks(move.to_square)

        for attacked_sq in attacked_squares:
            attacked_piece = board.piece_at(attacked_sq)
            if not attacked_piece or attacked_piece.color == attacking_piece.color:
                continue

            # Check if there's a less valuable piece behind (x-ray)
            # Use piece values to identify skewer pattern
            attacked_value = PIECE_VALUES[attacked_piece.piece_type]

            # Get x-ray attacks (pieces behind the attacked piece)
            if attacking_piece.piece_type in [chess.ROOK, chess.QUEEN]:
                xray_attacks = xray_rook_attackers(board, attacking_piece.color, attacked_sq)

            elif attacking_piece.piece_type in [chess.BISHOP, chess.QUEEN]:
                xray_attacks = xray_bishop_attackers(board, attacking_piece.color, attacked_sq)
            else:
                continue

            # Check if any x-ray target is less valuable (skewer pattern)
            for xray_sq in xray_attacks:
                xray_piece = board.piece_at(xray_sq)
                if xray_piece and xray_piece.color != attacking_piece.color:
                    xray_value = PIECE_VALUES[xray_piece.piece_type]

                    if attacked_value > xray_value:
                        skewers.append({
                            'moveNumber': move_num + 1,
                            'attacker': chess.square_name(move.to_square),
                            'attackerPiece': attacking_piece.symbol(),
                            'target': chess.square_name(attacked_sq),
                            'targetPiece': attacked_piece.symbol(),
                            'behind': chess.square_name(xray_sq),
                            'behindPiece': xray_piece.symbol()
                        })

    return {
        'totalSkewers': len(skewers),
        'skewerExamples': skewers[:5]  # Top 5 examples
    }
```

**Fun Stats:**
- 🍢 "Shish Kebab Award" - Most skewers created
- 🎯 "X-Ray Vision" - Player who saw through opponent's pieces most

**Effort:** 4-5 hours (requires x-ray logic, piece value comparison)

**Performance:** ~3-5 seconds for 20 games

#### 9. Forks Detected 🍴
**Definition:** Detect when one piece attacks two or more opponent pieces simultaneously.

**Complexity:** 🟡 MEDIUM

**Best Approach:** Python (python-chess)
- Use `board.attacks(square)` after each move
- Count how many opponent pieces are attacked

**Implementation:**
```python
def detect_forks(game):
    """Detect forks in the game"""
    board = game.board()
    forks = []

    for move_num, move in enumerate(game.mainline_moves()):
        board.push(move)

        moving_piece = board.piece_at(move.to_square)
        if not moving_piece:
            continue

        # Get all squares attacked by the piece that just moved
        attacked_squares = board.attacks(move.to_square)

        # Count opponent pieces attacked
        attacked_pieces = []
        for sq in attacked_squares:
            piece = board.piece_at(sq)
            if piece and piece.color != moving_piece.color:
                attacked_pieces.append({
                    'square': chess.square_name(sq),
                    'piece': piece.symbol(),
                    'value': PIECE_VALUES[piece.piece_type]
                })

        # Fork = attacking 2+ pieces
        if len(attacked_pieces) >= 2:
            forks.append({
                'moveNumber': move_num + 1,
                'forkingPiece': moving_piece.symbol(),
                'forkingSquare': chess.square_name(move.to_square),
                'attackedPieces': attacked_pieces,
                'forkValue': sum(p['value'] for p in attacked_pieces),
                'isKnightFork': moving_piece.piece_type == chess.KNIGHT,
                'isRoyalFork': any(p['piece'].lower() == 'k' for p in attacked_pieces)  # King involved
            })

    return {
        'totalForks': len(forks),
        'knightForks': sum(1 for f in forks if f['isKnightFork']),
        'royalForks': sum(1 for f in forks if f['isRoyalFork']),
        'biggestFork': max(forks, key=lambda f: f['forkValue']) if forks else None,
        'forkExamples': forks[:5]
    }
```

**Fun Stats:**
- 🍴 "Fork Master" - Most forks created
- ♞ "Knight Life" - Most knight forks
- 👑 "Royal Fork" - Fork involving the king (family fork)
- 🍽️ "Buffet Fork" - Fork attacking 3+ pieces

**Effort:** 3-4 hours

**Performance:** ~2-3 seconds for 20 games

#### 10. Discovered Attacks 💥
**Definition:** Moving a piece reveals an attack from a piece behind it.

**Complexity:** 🔴 MEDIUM-HIGH

**Best Approach:** Python (python-chess)
- Track x-ray attacks before and after moves
- Detect when a move uncovers an attack

**Implementation:**
```python
def detect_discovered_attacks(game):
    """Detect discovered attacks in the game"""
    board = game.board()
    discovered = []

    for move_num, move in enumerate(game.mainline_moves()):
        # Get position before move
        before_attacks = set()
        for sq in chess.SQUARES:
            piece = board.piece_at(sq)
            if piece and piece.color == board.turn:
                before_attacks.update(board.attacks(sq))

        board.push(move)

        # Get position after move
        after_attacks = set()
        for sq in chess.SQUARES:
            piece = board.piece_at(sq)
            if piece and piece.color != board.turn:  # Previous mover
                after_attacks.update(board.attacks(sq))

        # Find new attacks that weren't there before (excluding the moved piece)
        new_attacks = after_attacks - before_attacks
        moved_piece_attacks = board.attacks(move.to_square)
        discovered_attacks = new_attacks - moved_piece_attacks

        if discovered_attacks:
            # Find which piece created the discovered attack
            for sq in chess.SQUARES:
                piece = board.piece_at(sq)
                if piece and piece.color != board.turn and sq != move.to_square:
                    piece_attacks = board.attacks(sq)
                    if piece_attacks & discovered_attacks:
                        discovered.append({
                            'moveNumber': move_num + 1,
                            'movingPiece': chess.square_name(move.from_square),
                            'revealedPiece': chess.square_name(sq),
                            'revealedAttacks': [chess.square_name(s) for s in discovered_attacks]
                        })
                        break

    return {
        'totalDiscovered': len(discovered),
        'examples': discovered[:5]
    }
```

**Fun Stats:**
- 💥 "Magic Reveal" - Most discovered attacks
- 🎭 "Curtain Call" - Best discovered check

**Effort:** 5-6 hours (complex attack tracking)

**Performance:** ~5-8 seconds for 20 games

---

## ORIGINAL PROPOSED STATISTICS

### 1. Most Backwards Moves 🔙
**Definition:** Track pieces moving closer to their starting rank (retreating).

**Complexity:** 🟡 MEDIUM

**Best Approach:** JavaScript (chess.js)
- Can be calculated from existing move history
- No engine evaluation needed
- Logic: Compare move.from and move.to ranks for each piece

**Implementation:**
```javascript
function isBackwardMove(move, color) {
  const fromRank = parseInt(move.from[1]);
  const toRank = parseInt(move.to[1]);

  if (color === 'w') {
    return toRank < fromRank; // White moving toward rank 1
  } else {
    return toRank > fromRank; // Black moving toward rank 8
  }
}

// Track per game
let backwardMoves = { white: 0, black: 0 };
history.forEach(move => {
  if (isBackwardMove(move, move.color)) {
    backwardMoves[move.color]++;
  }
});
```

**Effort:** 2-3 hours (including testing and fun stats integration)

### 2. Biggest Piece Imbalance 📊
**Definition:** Track material advantage throughout the game, identify biggest swing.

**Complexity:** 🟡 MEDIUM

**Best Approach:** Python (python-chess) **OR** JavaScript with custom logic

**Python Implementation (Recommended):**
```python
PIECE_VALUES = {
    chess.PAWN: 1,
    chess.KNIGHT: 3,
    chess.BISHOP: 3,
    chess.ROOK: 5,
    chess.QUEEN: 9
}

def calculate_material_balance(board):
    """Returns material advantage for white (positive = white ahead)"""
    white_material = 0
    black_material = 0

    for square, piece in board.piece_map().items():
        value = PIECE_VALUES.get(piece.piece_type, 0)
        if piece.color == chess.WHITE:
            white_material += value
        else:
            black_material += value

    return white_material - black_material

# Track throughout game
max_imbalance = {'move': 0, 'advantage': 0, 'color': None}
for move_num, move in enumerate(game.mainline_moves()):
    board.push(move)
    balance = calculate_material_balance(board)

    if abs(balance) > abs(max_imbalance['advantage']):
        max_imbalance = {
            'move': move_num + 1,
            'advantage': abs(balance),
            'color': 'white' if balance > 0 else 'black'
        }
```

**JavaScript Alternative:**
- Track captures and piece values manually
- Calculate material after each capture event
- More complex but avoids Python dependency

**Effort:**
- Python: 3-4 hours (modify analyze-pgn.py, add to stats output)
- JavaScript: 5-6 hours (manual piece tracking)

### 3. Mobility Tracking 📈
**Definition:** Track number of legal moves available at each position.

**Complexity:** 🔴 MEDIUM-HIGH

**Best Approach:** Python (python-chess)
- `len(list(board.legal_moves))` gives exact count
- chess.js requires generating all moves at each position (slower)

**Python Implementation:**
```python
def analyze_mobility(game):
    """Track legal move counts throughout game"""
    board = game.board()
    mobility_history = []

    for move in game.mainline_moves():
        white_moves = len(list(board.legal_moves)) if board.turn == chess.WHITE else 0
        board.push(move)
        black_moves = len(list(board.legal_moves)) if board.turn == chess.BLACK else 0
        board.undo()

        mobility_history.append({
            'white': white_moves,
            'black': black_moves,
            'delta': white_moves - black_moves
        })

        board.push(move)

    # Find biggest mobility advantage
    max_advantage = max(mobility_history, key=lambda x: abs(x['delta']))
    return {
        'maxAdvantage': max_advantage,
        'averageWhiteMobility': sum(m['white'] for m in mobility_history) / len(mobility_history),
        'averageBlackMobility': sum(m['black'] for m in mobility_history) / len(mobility_history)
    }
```

**Effort:** 4-5 hours (Python integration, testing with 20 games)

### 4. Space Control 🗺️
**Definition:** Count squares controlled/attacked by each side.

**Complexity:** 🔴 HIGH

**Best Approach:** Python (python-chess)
- `board.attackers(color, square)` for each square
- chess.js lacks direct "squares controlled" API

**Python Implementation:**
```python
def calculate_space_control(board):
    """Count squares controlled by each color"""
    white_control = 0
    black_control = 0

    for square in chess.SQUARES:
        white_attackers = len(board.attackers(chess.WHITE, square))
        black_attackers = len(board.attackers(chess.BLACK, square))

        if white_attackers > 0:
            white_control += 1
        if black_attackers > 0:
            black_control += 1

    return {
        'white': white_control,
        'black': black_control,
        'delta': white_control - black_control
    }
```

**Performance Note:** Calculating for ALL positions is expensive (64 squares × moves).
**Optimization:** Sample every 5th move or only at key moments (captures, checks).

**Effort:** 5-6 hours (implementation + optimization for performance)

### 5. Development Tracking 🏗️
**Definition:** Track pieces moved off starting squares (measure opening development).

**Complexity:** 🟢 LOW-MEDIUM

**Best Approach:** Either JavaScript or Python

**JavaScript Implementation:**
```javascript
const STARTING_SQUARES = {
  w: ['a1', 'b1', 'c1', 'd1', 'e1', 'f1', 'g1', 'h1', 'a2', 'b2', 'c2', 'd2', 'e2', 'f2', 'g2', 'h2'],
  b: ['a8', 'b8', 'c8', 'd8', 'e8', 'f8', 'g8', 'h8', 'a7', 'b7', 'c7', 'd7', 'e7', 'f7', 'g7', 'h7']
};

function trackDevelopment(game) {
  const developed = { w: new Set(), b: new Set() };

  game.moveList.forEach((move, index) => {
    // Skip pawn moves
    if (move.piece !== 'p' && STARTING_SQUARES[move.color].includes(move.from)) {
      developed[move.color].add(move.piece + move.from);
    }

    // Track development at move 10 (early game benchmark)
    if (index === 19) { // Move 10 for white
      return {
        white: developed.w.size,
        black: developed.b.size,
        delta: developed.w.size - developed.b.size
      };
    }
  });
}
```

**Effort:** 2-3 hours (JavaScript) or 3-4 hours (Python with full game tracking)

### 6. King Safety Metrics 🛡️
**Definition:** Track threats near king, king exposure, pawn shield.

**Complexity:** 🔴 HIGH

**Best Approach:** Python (python-chess)
- Use `board.attackers()` for threats to king zone
- Calculate pawn shield integrity
- Track king distance from corners/center

**Python Implementation:**
```python
def calculate_king_safety(board, color):
    """Calculate king safety score"""
    king_square = board.king(color)

    # Pawn shield (pawns near king)
    pawn_shield = 0
    king_file = chess.square_file(king_square)
    king_rank = chess.square_rank(king_square)

    # Check surrounding squares for friendly pawns
    for file_offset in [-1, 0, 1]:
        for rank_offset in [1 if color == chess.WHITE else -1]:
            check_file = king_file + file_offset
            check_rank = king_rank + rank_offset

            if 0 <= check_file <= 7 and 0 <= check_rank <= 7:
                check_square = chess.square(check_file, check_rank)
                piece = board.piece_at(check_square)

                if piece and piece.piece_type == chess.PAWN and piece.color == color:
                    pawn_shield += 1

    # Count enemy attacks on king zone (king + surrounding squares)
    attacks = 0
    for offset_file in [-1, 0, 1]:
        for offset_rank in [-1, 0, 1]:
            square = chess.square(
                king_file + offset_file,
                king_rank + offset_rank
            )
            attacks += len(board.attackers(not color, square))

    return {
        'pawnShield': pawn_shield,
        'attacksOnKingZone': attacks,
        'kingSafety': pawn_shield * 10 - attacks * 5  # Simple scoring
    }
```

**Effort:** 6-8 hours (complex logic, extensive testing)

## Recommendation: JavaScript vs Python

### Use JavaScript (chess.js) When:
✅ Statistics can be derived from move history alone
✅ No board state evaluation needed
✅ Performance is critical (avoid Python subprocess overhead)
✅ Examples: Backwards moves, pawn storms, piece loyalty

**Pros:**
- Already integrated in pipeline
- Fast execution
- Easy to add to existing calculators
- No additional dependencies

**Cons:**
- Limited state analysis APIs
- Manual piece tracking required
- No built-in evaluation helpers

### Use Python (python-chess) When:
✅ Need detailed board state at each position
✅ Require attack/defend calculations
✅ Want to leverage Stockfish for deep analysis
✅ Complex positional metrics (space, mobility, king safety)

**Pros:**
- Rich board state APIs
- Built-in attack/defend calculations
- Stockfish already integrated
- Better for material/positional analysis

**Cons:**
- Requires running Python subprocess
- Slower than JavaScript (but acceptable for 20 games)
- Already used for accuracy analysis (adds complexity)

## Performance Considerations

### Current Performance (20 games):
- **Without analysis:** <5 seconds (JavaScript only)
- **With Stockfish analysis:** ~5-10 minutes (Python + Stockfish depth 15)

### Expected Performance Impact:

**JavaScript-based stats:**
- Backwards moves: +0.5s
- Development tracking: +0.5s
- Material imbalance (manual): +1s
- **Total impact:** ~2 seconds for 20 games

**Python-based stats (all moves analyzed):**
- Pins detection: +2s
- Forks detection: +3s
- Material imbalance: +2s
- Mobility tracking: +10s
- Skewers detection: +5s
- Discovered attacks: +8s
- Space control: +15s
- King safety: +20s
- **Total impact:** ~65 seconds for 20 games (without sampling)

**Optimization Strategies:**
1. **Sample moves:** Analyze every 5th or 10th move
2. **Cache board states:** Avoid recalculating positions
3. **Parallel processing:** Analyze multiple games concurrently
4. **Selective analysis:** Only calculate for "interesting" positions (captures, checks)

## Recommended Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Low-Hanging Fruit (JavaScript) 🟢
**Time: 4-6 hours**

1. **Backwards Moves** - Add to fun-stats.js
2. **Development Tracking** - Add to game-phases.js

### Technical Approach

**Python (python-chess) for Tactical Detection:**
```python
# Extend analyze-pgn.py with:
- detect_pins_in_game()      # Built-in is_pinned()
- detect_forks()              # Count attacks per move
- calculate_material_balance()  # Track piece values
```

**Output Format:**
```json
{
  "tactics": {
    "pins": {
      "total": 15,
      "whitePinned": 7,
      "blackPinned": 8,
      "examples": [...]
    },
    "forks": {
      "total": 23,
      "knightForks": 12,
      "royalForks": 3,
      "biggest": {...}
    }
  }
}
```

### Performance Budget

**Goal: Keep total generation under 20 seconds**

Current breakdown:
- PGN parsing (JS): ~2s
- Stockfish analysis (optional): ~5-10 minutes
- Basic stats calculation (JS): ~3s
- **New tactical detection (Python): ~8s**
- **Total without Stockfish: ~13 seconds** ✅

### Feasibility: ✅ HIGHLY FEASIBLE

**You already have:**
- ✅ python-chess installed with Stockfish
- ✅ analyze-pgn.py infrastructure
- ✅ JSON output pipeline
- ✅ TypeScript interfaces for stats
- ✅ Modular component system

**What's needed:**
1. Add tactical detection functions to analyze-pgn.py
2. Update TypeScript interfaces for tactical data
3. Create `TacticsSection.tsx` component
4. Add tactical awards to fun-stats

**Estimated Total Time:** 12-15 hours for Phase 1 (pins + forks + awards)

### Next Steps

**I recommend starting with:**
1. **Pins detection** - Easiest, built-in API, instant results
2. Test with `round1.pgn` to verify performance
3. Create UI component to display pins
4. Add **Forks detection** next
5. Get user feedback before Phase 3

**Would you like me to:**
- Implement pins detection as a proof-of-concept?
- Create the Python code for analyze-pgn.py?
- Design the TypeScript interface for tactical data?

The tactical patterns approach gives you the **best value for development time** and will be **most exciting for your tournament players**!
