## Component Architecture (Phase 3 Refactoring)

### Stats Components Created
All located in `/components/stats/`:

1. **stat-card.tsx** - Reusable wrapper component for all stat sections
2. **round-header.tsx** - Page title, navigation, broadcast link
3. **overview-stats.tsx** - 4 colored stat boxes (total games, moves, etc.)
4. **results-breakdown.tsx** - Win/loss/draw with progress bars + pie chart
5. **awards-section.tsx** - Gold gradient awards section
6. **game-phases.tsx** - Opening/middlegame/endgame analysis
7. **tactics-section.tsx** - Captures, castling, promotions
8. **openings-section.tsx** - First move statistics + opening variations with ECO codes
9. **piece-stats.tsx** - Activity with proper labels
10. **notable-games.tsx** - Longest/shortest games
11. **fun-stats.tsx** - 9 fun statistics cards
12. **checkmates-section.tsx** - Checkmate analysis
13. **board-heatmap-section.tsx** - Interactive heatmap
14. **opening-popularity-chart.tsx** - Bar chart for opening move popularity
15. **win-rate-chart.tsx** - Pie chart for game results

### Benefits Achieved

## Technical Implementation Details

### Opening Database
- **Source:** Lichess chess-openings (https://github.com/lichess-org/chess-openings)
- **License:** CC0 Public Domain
- **Format:** TSV files (a.tsv through e.tsv)
- **Coverage:** 3,546 openings with ECO codes, names, and PGN sequences
- **Build Script:** `scripts/utils/build-openings-db.js`
- **Output:** `scripts/utils/chess-openings.js` (efficient lookup module)

### Manhattan Distance Calculation
```javascript
const calculateDistance = (from, to) => {
  const fromFile = from.charCodeAt(0) - 'a'.charCodeAt(0);
  const fromRank = parseInt(from[1]) - 1;
  const toFile = to.charCodeAt(0) - 'a'.charCodeAt(0);
  const toRank = parseInt(to[1]) - 1;
  return Math.abs(toFile - fromFile) + Math.abs(toRank - fromRank);
};
```

### Move Notation Formatting
```javascript
// Converts "e4 c5 Nf3 d6 Bc4 Nc6" to "1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6 3.Bc4 Nc6"
const formatMoves = (moves: string) => {
  const moveArray = moves.split(' ')
  let formatted = ''
  let moveNumber = 1
  for (let i = 0; i < moveArray.length; i++) {
    if (i % 2 === 0) {
      formatted += `${moveNumber}.${moveArray[i]}`
    } else {
      formatted += ` ${moveArray[i]}`
      moveNumber++
    }
    if (i < moveArray.length - 1 && i % 2 === 1) {
      formatted += ' '
    }
  }
  return formatted
}
```
