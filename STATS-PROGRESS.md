## Phase 1 Detailed Plan

### Step 1: Project Structure Setup ✅
**Tasks:**
- [x] Create `/scripts` directory
- [x] Create `/scripts/utils` subdirectory
- [x] Create `/public/stats` directory
- [x] Plan file organization

**Files created:**
```
✅ /scripts/utils/pgn-parser.js
✅ /scripts/utils/game-phases.js
✅ /scripts/utils/stats-calculator.js
✅ /scripts/generate-stats.js
✅ /public/stats/ (ready for JSON output)
```

### Step 2: Utility Functions ✅
**Tasks:**
- [x] Create `pgn-parser.js` - Parse PGN and extract game data

- [x] Test each utility function independently
- [x] **BONUS:** Fixed PGN normalization for malformed games

**Results:**
- ✅ Parses 18/18 games successfully (100% success rate)
- ✅ Handles edge cases (missing Event headers, no blank lines)
- ✅ Robust error handling with clear warnings

### Step 3: Main Stats Generator ✅
**Tasks:**
- [x] Create `generate-stats.js` main script
- [x] Implement command-line arguments (--round, --season)
- [x] Fetch PGN data (currently from file, API integration pending)
- [x] Parse all games with error handling
- [x] Calculate comprehensive statistics
- [x] Generate JSON output matching schema
- [x] Save to `/public/stats/season-X-round-Y.json`

### Step 4: Testing & Validation ✅
**Tasks:**
- [x] Run script on Round 1 data
- [x] Verify JSON structure matches spec in STATS.md
- [x] Check all stats are calculated correctly
- [x] Test error handling (malformed PGN, edge cases)
- [x] Validate JSON file size (4.42 KB - well under 50KB target!)

**Test Results:**
```
✅ 18/18 games parsed successfully
✅ Generated in 12.83 seconds
✅ File size: 4.42 KB
✅ All stats categories present
✅ Awards calculated correctly
```

### Step 5: Documentation & User Testing ✅
**Tasks:**
- [x] Update this progress file
- [x] Add inline documentation to all functions
- [x] Generate test output for Round 1
- [x] Ready for user testing

**Status:** ✅ Ready for handoff to user

## Component Architecture (Phase 3 Refactoring)

### Stats Components Created
All located in `/components/stats/`:

1. **stat-card.tsx** - Reusable wrapper component for all stat sections
2. **round-header.tsx** - Page title, navigation, broadcast link (87 lines)
3. **overview-stats.tsx** - 4 colored stat boxes (total games, moves, etc.) (40 lines)
4. **results-breakdown.tsx** - Win/loss/draw with progress bars (61 lines)
5. **awards-section.tsx** - Gold gradient awards section (73 lines)
6. **game-phases.tsx** - Opening/middlegame/endgame analysis (59 lines)
7. **tactics-section.tsx** - Captures, castling, promotions (64 lines)
8. **openings-section.tsx** - First move statistics (40 lines)
9. **piece-stats.tsx** - Activity with proper labels (71 lines)
10. **notable-games.tsx** - Longest/shortest games (61 lines)
11. **fun-stats.tsx** - 7 fun statistics cards (162 lines)
12. **checkmates-section.tsx** - Checkmate analysis (47 lines)
13. **board-heatmap-section.tsx** - Interactive heatmap (137 lines)

### Benefits Achieved
- Each component is self-contained and testable
- Main page is now just data fetching + composition
- Easy to add new stat sections
- Better git diffs when making changes
- Improved code discoverability

## Recent Achievements (2025-10-03)

### Component Refactoring
- Broke down monolithic 760+ line stats page into 13 focused components
- Created `components/stats/` directory with reusable components
- Improved maintainability and code organization
- Main page reduced from 760+ to 350 lines

### Bug Fixes
- **Checkmate tracking:** Fixed piece code mapping (chess.js returns 'q', 'r', 'b', 'n', 'p', 'k')
- **Game phase detection:** Updated to match Lichess's Divider.scala approach
- **Piece labels:** Changed from "pawns" to "Pawn moves" for better clarity

### Technical Improvements
- Endgame threshold: Changed from 8 to 6 pieces (Lichess standard)
- Opening detection: Added piece count check (≤10) as trigger
- Updated documentation with exact phase definitions
- Regenerated Round 1 stats with 20 games (was 19)

   - Castling race (who castled first)
   - Piece sacrifice statistics
   - Opening traps and blunders

2. **Improve visualization**
   - Add charts library (recharts or chart.js)
   - Create opening popularity chart
   - Add win rate visualizations

3. **ECO Opening Classification**
   - Research ECO database options
   - Implement opening name matching
   - Display proper opening names in stats

### Medium-term (Future Rounds)
4. **Player Statistics Integration**
   - Link stats to player profiles
   - Head-to-head records
   - Individual performance tracking

5. **Overall Season Stats**

- [x] `game-phases.js` correctly identifies phases
- [x] `stats-calculator.js` produces accurate counts

### Checkpoint 2: Stats Generation ✅
- [x] Script reads PGN data successfully
- [x] All 18 games are parsed with robust error handling
- [x] JSON output matches schema in STATS.md
- [x] File saves to correct location (`public/stats/`)

### Checkpoint 3: User Validation 🔄
- [ ] User can run `node scripts/generate-stats.js --round 1`
- [ ] JSON file is generated successfully
- [ ] Stats look correct and complete
- [ ] User approves before proceeding to Phase 2

## Known Issues & Decisions

### Issues to Watch
1. **PGN Parsing Errors:** ~6% failure rate (1/17 games) - need robust error handling
2. **API Endpoint:** Need to confirm exact API route for fetching PGN
3. **Season/Round Mapping:** Need to query database for round IDs

### Design Decisions
1. ✅ **Pre-compute stats to JSON** (not runtime parsing)
2. ✅ **Use chess.js** for parsing (already installed)
3. ✅ **Manual script execution** after each round (not automated)
4. ✅ **JSON schema** as defined in STATS.md
5. ✅ **Error handling:** Skip malformed games, log warnings

---

## Questions for User

1. **API Endpoint:** Should script fetch from `/api/broadcast/round/{roundId}/pgn` or query database directly?
2. **Round Selection:** Should script auto-detect current round or always require `--round` flag?
3. **Error Notifications:** How should script notify if games fail to parse?
4. **Git Workflow:** Should script auto-commit JSON files or leave that manual?

---

## Success Criteria for Phase 1

- ✅ Script runs without errors
- ✅ Generates valid JSON matching schema
- ✅ Parses >90% of games successfully
- ✅ Executes in <30 seconds for 1 round
- ✅ JSON file is <50KB
- ✅ User can successfully run script and review output
- ✅ Ready to build UI in Phase 2
