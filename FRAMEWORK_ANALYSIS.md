## Recommendation

### Primary Choice: **Next.js 15 with App Router**

**Reasoning:**
1. **Full-stack solution** - API routes for handling registration, bye requests
2. **Vercel deployment** - Perfect git-based workflow, generous free tier
3. **Form handling** - Server Actions make form submission trivial
4. **Database options** - Easy integration with Vercel Postgres or Planetscale
5. **Email service** - Simple integration with Resend or SendGrid
6. **Authentication** - Can use NextAuth.js or simple email-based auth
7. **TailwindCSS 4** - First-class support
8. **TypeScript** - Excellent support for type safety

### Alternative: **Astro** (if simplicity preferred)

**When to choose:**
- If most content is static
- If you want minimal complexity
- If JavaScript bundle size is critical
- Can use Astro DB for simple data needs

## Database Recommendations

### For Next.js:
1. **Vercel Postgres** - Seamless integration, serverless
2. **Planetscale** - MySQL, great free tier, branching
3. **Supabase** - PostgreSQL + Auth + Realtime

### For Simple Needs:
1. **SQLite with Turso** - Edge-hosted SQLite
2. **Astro DB** - If using Astro

## Deployment Platform

### Recommended: **Vercel**
- Git-based deployment
- Automatic preview deployments
- Environment variables management
- Edge functions for better performance
- Custom domains on free tier
- Automatic SSL

### Alternatives:
- **Netlify** - Similar to Vercel, good for Astro
- **Cloudflare Pages** - Fast, generous limits
- **Railway** - If you need more backend control
