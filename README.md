## Development

### Database Operations

**Production Migration Workflow:**
```bash
# 1. Create new migration (development only)
npm run db:migrate:dev

# 2. Test locally
npm run dev
npm run db:studio

# 3. Push to main branch - Vercel auto-deploys migrations
git push origin main
```

**Development Commands:**
```bash
# Create new migration
npm run db:migrate:dev

# Deploy existing migrations
npm run db:migrate:deploy

# Prototype schema changes (no migration)
npm run db:push

# View database
npm run db:studio

# Seed with test data
npm run db:seed
```

### Statistics Generation

Generate comprehensive round statistics from PGN data:

```bash
# 1. Download latest PGN from broadcast API
curl -o /tmp/round1-fresh.pgn https://classical.schachklub-k4.ch/api/broadcast/round/cmfekevr50001l5045y65op37/pgn

# 2. Generate statistics JSON
node scripts/generate-stats.js --round 1

# 3. Stats are saved to public/stats/season-2-round-1.json
# 4. View at http://localhost:3000/stats
```
